# blockstuff

a very simple firefox extension i wrote to block a few websites i found myself wasting too much time on. there were previously plenty of extensions that did this, but one update broke all of them so i wrote my own super simple version.

in the future i may build a gui for it and publish it.

if you stumbled across this and want to install it yourself learn how [here.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Developing_WebExtensions_for_Firefox_for_Android)
